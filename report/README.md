# Report Overview
This report compares the performance of **Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** in an image classification task using the **Intel Image Classification dataset**. The study explores how different hyperparameter settings impact model performance and highlights the advantages of CNNs in extracting spatial features.

## Key Findings
- CNNs consistently outperform MLPs in image classification due to their ability to extract spatial patterns.
- MLPs struggle with capturing spatial relationships, leading to lower accuracy.
- Hyperparameter tuning, particularly learning rate adjustment, significantly affects model performance.
- Future work suggests k-fold cross-validation and pre-trained CNN models (e.g., VGG, ResNet) to further enhance classification accuracy.
